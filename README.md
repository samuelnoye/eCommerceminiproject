# eCommerceminiproject
In this project, you're tasked to build an Inventory Management Dashboard using HTML, CSS
and JavaScript. This project should allow for the performance of the following operations:
• Add item (name, description, category, quantity available)
• Update quantity or stock
• Update item details
• Remove item
Create a page each for the above listed operations (and additional pages as you see fit). In addition, 
the index page should be a dashboard which lists the various items with all its details (name, 
description, category, quantity available). The dashboard should have some summary, like the total 
number of items, items in stock, total number of categories, etc.
Labels: Labels are visual indicators to show if a product is out of stock, almost out of stock or 
in stock. If an item has a quantity of 0, then it is about of stock. If the quantity is between 1 and 
20, then it is almost out of stock. Items with quantity of 21 and above are classified as in stock. 
Use red, orange and green to represent out of stock, almost out of stock and in stock 
respectively. Make use of labels in your dashboard.
For data storage, kindly use HTML5's Local Storage.
